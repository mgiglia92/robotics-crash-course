                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <ul class="bom">
                    <li>Last summer, during RCC, the PicoW had just released and
                    we were interestedðŸ‘€</li>
                    <li>After working with Picos developing The Tank (an
                    autonomous robot with 3 pico's inside) and Carrie (a
                    wireless robotic car capable of parallel parking), we
                    decided to make the switch to the Pico as the
                    microcontroller for RCC2023.</li>
                    <li>The Raft board allows RCC students to enjoy everything
                    the PicoW has to offer and learn all about the amazing
                    software that was developed .</li> 
                    <li>As the name v0.3 suggests, we mass produced the third
                    iteration of the board, and we're already working on v0.4
                    for everyone from high school to first year undergraduates
                    to graduate students building mobile robots.</li>
                    <li>Most importantly, PicoW's are really fun! This board
                    allows for easy and interfacing with any sensors and
                    actuators and the Pico.</li>

                <h3>Some things to keep in mind:</h3>
                <ul class="bom">
                    <li>Some Rafts do not have operational level shifters, and
                    servo's must be driven by a 3V3 PWM signal, this does not
                    impact the functionality of the servo, but the wiring is a
                    little different. The <a href="electrical.html"
                    target="_blank">electrical assembly guide</a> shows how to
                    plug in a servo in the case that the level shifters are not
                    operational</li>

                <ul class="bom">
                    <li>The Rafts were designed in KiCAD and the fabrication
                    files can be <a href="https://github.com/jcirce/rcc-pico-shield" target="_blank">found here</a></li> 
                    <li>All v0.3 Rafts were assembled in NYC with Lead-Free solder and solder paste</li>
                    <li>Some Rafts have a different color palette, functionality
                        is not impacted and we consider these boards "limited
                        edition"</li> 
                    <li>All v0.3 Rafts have a serial number and detailed notes
                        were taken during the fabrication process, if your raft has
                        a special quirk, there is a record and RCC staff will inform
                        you if your board should have something to keep an eye
